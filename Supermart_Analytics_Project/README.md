## Folder Structure
- **data/**: Contains raw and cleaned datasets.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, EDA, and model building.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts (e.g., exporting data to Excel).
- **reports/**: Generated reports (Excel, PDF).
- **app/**: (Optional) Streamlit dashboard for interactive visualization.
- **requirements.txt**: List of project dependencies.

## How to Run
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Run data_cleaning.py or open notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb to clean and preprocess the data.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Open notebooks/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb to perform EDA and generate visualizations.

4. **Model Building:** Run ml_model.py or open notebooks/model_building.ipynb to train and evaluate the ML model.

5. **Generate Reports:** Run python scripts/data_to_excel.py to export data to Excel (saved in the reports folder).

6. **Dashboard (Optional):** Run streamlit run app/dashboard.py to launch the interactive dashboard.
